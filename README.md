Welcome to FAIT.

FAIT is a flow-analysis framework designed to be used by a programming
environment.  It is designed to run incrementally as the user edits,
providing continuing feedback on potential problems.  Currently the
system concentrates on security-related problems.

Building FAIT will require ivy.  Also you will need faitmock and karma
in order to use it.
